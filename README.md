# MNIST K-Means Clustering

This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch and applies it to the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. It includes multiple clustering validation metrics and analysis of clustering performance with different parameters.

## Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
- Implement K-Means algorithm from scratch
- Apply it to the MNIST dataset
- Evaluate clustering quality using various validation metrics
- Analyze the effect of different K values and initializations
- Optionally classify the test set based on clusters

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the MNIST dataset files
- `src/`: Source code for K-Means and validation metrics
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- `scripts/`: Executable scripts for running the analysis
- `tests/`: Unit tests
- `results/`: Output figures and results

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy
- scikit-learn (for comparison)
- tqdm (for progress bars)
